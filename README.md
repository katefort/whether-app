# Whether
In order to reflect the 'Zen' theme for KnightHacks 2021, our team wanted to create a tool to ease the mental burden taken on by students every semester.
Especially in Florida, weather is a scheduling factor that can make or break your schedule.
No one likes showing up to appointments wet, and even the best umbrella can only do so much.

By merging the functionality of a scheduler and live weather, students should be able to better plan their commutes, ensuring a dry arrival.
